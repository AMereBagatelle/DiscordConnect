# Discord Connect
This is a mod I wrote to make discord linking easy.  With only one configuration file to edit, it shouldn't take long to set up and begin use.

### Installation
This mod is quite simple to configure and use.
Simply drop the mod in your mods folder, attempt to start the server.  The server will crash the first time you try to use the mod.
After this crash, you should now have a `discordconnect.properties` file in your config directory.
You can use this file to define the token for your bot and the server (guild) ID and channel ID that you would like the chatlink to use.
After configuring this, your bot should be ready for use!

You will need to create your own bot for use with this mod, if you don't know how to do that follow the first step of this tutorial, and use the token that it points out.

### Support
I have decided to stop supporting this mod. It will be on 1.15 forever.  If you would like to update it, feel free to fork it.
